Background of SENSE-EGRA Project:

An Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) educational intervention program tagged ‘Strengthening Education in Northeast Nigeria’ – (SENSE), of the American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola, Adamawa State sponsored by the United State Agency for International Development (USAID) aimed at improving the literacy of over 200,000 primary school pupils targeting two northeastern states of Adamawa and Gombe that were affected by terrorist’s conflicts. The intervention program's impact on the task of letter identification was evaluated using statistical methods and tools, and it showed a positive effect, in the subtask under study, albeit causal claims could not be elicited from the intervention program due to the fact that the program was not designed with the setting of an A/B test. Thus, the objectives of this work was to use structural causal model (SCM) framework and or the potential outcome framework, which are frameworks employed in dealing optimally with the issues of confounding and selection biases to analyze and estimate causal inferences and make causal claims on intervention impact program such as SENSE-EGRA.
